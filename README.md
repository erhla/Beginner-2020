# Hacking 4 Justice Beginner Workshop

Welcome to the [H4J Beginner Workshop](https://hacking4justice.org/learn)! Please read this document carefully, as it will help you prepare and get the most out of your learning experience. In particular, be sure to complete the [workshop prep tasks](#workshop-prep) before our first meeting. The Day One **R Scripts** are also posted in this repository. Here, you will also have the opportunity to share the code you wrote in Day Two.

We always want to keep improving – whether you are a trainer, coach or student, please feel free to use this space to make comments or suggestions. For example, if something didn't make sense to you or your students, you can let us know directly here. Feel free to suggest any alternative strategies you and your team developed to complete the Day One tasks (using base R) – and of course, if there are typos or problems with the tutorial code, please let use know! 

If you are new to GitHub, you can learn the basics of collaboration [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## Workshop Prep

In this section, you will learn some basics about R and get ready to dive into work in our first class! If you have any issues with the practical steps in this guide, reach out to your assigned coach or kyla@hacking4justice.org for help. 

### What is R?

R is a programming language. It is a powerful and accessible tool that will help you to understand quantitative data. Unlike other expensive software (e.g. SPSS, STATA), R is free and open-source. The R community is also very supportive, offering  help and examples to solve virtually any problem. Beyond this, community members also create and share new packages to increase R functionality. We'll learn how packages work during Day One.

### Download and Install R

First, you will need to download R on your computer from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), short for the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork. We will learn more about CRAN when we learn about packages in Day One. For now, follow the appropriate links depending if you are on a Mac or Windows machine. For example, a Mac user would click here:

![cran1](cran1.png)

Also be sure to note that the version of R you download is compatible with the version of the operating system on your machine. For example, for Mac, the most recent version of R is compatible with OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and higher. If you have this operating system, click on the .pkg link.

Once the R setup file is downloaded:  

Mac users: Move the downloaded setup file to your Applications folder and follow the instructions to install R on your machine, using the default options.

Windows users: Run the downloaded setup file and follow the instructions to install R on your machine, using the default options.

### What is RStudio?

RStudio is an application that makes working with R easier and more fun. For example, RStudio creates a unified interface that will help to stay organized as you work. You must download RStudio in addition to R itself (which you already did above).

### Download and Install RStudio

You can download RStudio [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). When you click the link, it should recognize the most appropriate version of RStudio for your machine, so simply click on the blue button that looks like this (for Mac users):

Once the RStudio setup file is downloaded:  

Mac users: Move the downloaded setup file to your Applications folder and follow the instructions to install RStudio on your machine, using the default options.

Windows users: Run the downloaded setup file and follow the instructions to install RStudio on your machine, using the default options.

### Download CCSAO Data

In Day One of the workshop, we will focus on the Sentencing table. You can download this dataset [here](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Sentencing/tg8v-tm6u). 

![ccsao](ccsao.png)

As illustrated above, click "Export" and then "CSV" to download the data as a .csv file. Save this file in a clearly labeled, easily-accesible folder. For example, you might create a folder on your Desktop called "SAO-data." This will help you easily find the data during the Afternoon session of Day One. 

In Day Two, you may choose to look into the Sentencing dataset more deeply, or explore the other [datasets](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/browse?tags=state%27s%20attorney%20case-level) the CCSAO has made available. If you are interested in a particular table, feel free to download it now as well, following the steps above. Be sure to save it in the same folder as the Sentencing.csv file. 

## Day One 

Students can expect to spend Saturday morning each creating a small, fictional dataset of their own while they learn some of the building blocks of writing code in R. The whole class will be led by one Trainer at a time, but divided into small groups support by Coaches.

By the time lunch arrives, students will know how to create and manipulate vectors, matrices, and data frames, and apply simple logical operators and conditional statements. These basic tools are crucial to making sense of even the largest datasets.

After lunch, students will take the skills they learned by building miniature easy-to-read datasets and start applying them to the real SAO Sentencing dataset – beginning by loading new packages into base-R and importing the SAO file.

Understanding and interpreting data is a lot easier when you have defined all of the values yourself and you know what everything represents in the real world. Students will spend Saturday afternoon confronting an enormous, complex dataset that illustrates an enormous, complex justice system – and getting ready to start asking hard questions of the data themselves.

Saturday wraps up with a community dinner as a class.

## Day Two

Sunday is all about students digging into the real SAO datasets on their own terms and working to answer their own questions. After hearing from the SAO Data Team about (some of the) kinds of questions that the SAO is currently grappling with on a daily basis, students will be introduced to basic social science research methodology and each group will create their own research question to explore.

After spending several hours doing hands-on research, groups will take turns presenting their findings to the class at large, asking questions of each other and cementing their new analytical skills.

Sunday concludes the Workshop with ideas for next steps that students can take in their growth as criminal justice data scientists.
