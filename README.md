# Hacking 4 Justice Beginner Workshop

Welcome to the [H4J Beginner Workshop](https://hacking4justice.org/learn)! Please read this document carefully, as it will help you prepare and get the most out of your learning experience. In particular, be sure to complete the [workshop prep tasks](#workshop-prep) before our first meeting. The Day One **R Scripts** are also posted in this repository. Here, you will also have the opportunity to share the code you wrote in Day Two.

This is the first run with this workshop curiculuum, and it is a work-in-progress. Whether you are a trainer, coach or student, please feel free to use this space to make comments or suggestions. For example, if something didn't make sense to you or your students, you can let us know directly here. Also, feel free to suggest any alternative strategies you and your team developed to complete the Day One tasks (using base R). Of course, if there are typos or problems with the tutorial code, please let use know! 

If you are new to GitHub, you can learn the basics of collaberation [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## Workshop prep

In this section, you will learn some bascis about R and get ready to dive into work in our first class! If you have any issues with the practical steps in this guide, reach out to your assigned coach or kyla@hacking4justice.org for help. 

### What is R?

R is a programming language. It is a powerful and accessible tool that will help you to understand quantitative data. Unlike other expensive software (e.g. SPSS, STATA), R is free and open-source. The R community is also very supportive, offering  help and examples to solve virtually any problem. Beyond this, community members also create and share new packages to increase R functionality. We'll learn how packages work in Day One. 

For these reasons, R is an increasingly popular statistical tool.

### Download and Install R

First, you will need to download R on your computer from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), short for the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork. We will learn more about CRAN when we learn about packages in Day One. For now, follow the appropriate links depending if you are on a Mac or Windows machine. For example, a Mac user would click here:

Also be sure to note that the version of R you download is compatible with the version of the operating system on your machine. For example, for Mac, the most recent version of R is compatible with OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and higher. If you have this operating system, click on the .pkg link

Once the setup file is downloaded, run the file and follow the instructions to install R on your machine, using the default options.

### What is RStudio?

RStudio is an application that makes working with R easier and more fun to work with. You download RStudio in addition to R, which you already did above. RStudio creates a unified interface that will help to stay organized as you work. 

### Download and Install RStudio

You can download RStudio [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). When you click the link, it should recognize the most appropriate version of RStudio, so simply click on the blue button that looks like this (for Mac users):
